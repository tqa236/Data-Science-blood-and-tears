# Data Science - blood & tears
My experience while working in Data Science, so I don't have to relearn or reinvent any thing.

1. Early Stopping, but when?

According to [this paper](http://page.mi.fu-berlin.de/prechelt/Biblio/stop_tricks1997.pdf), slower stopping criteria allow for small
improvements in generalization (here: about 4% on average), but cost much more training time (here: about factor 4 longer on average).
